# Signing Tool with Private Key

This is a **work-in-progress** project aimed at creating a signing tool with private key functionality.

## Overview

- Built with **Next.js** and **TypeScript**.
- The final build consists of **static HTML, CSS, and JavaScript files**, ensuring the tool can run entirely offline.
  - This approach is critical as it keeps sensitive operations, like handling private keys, secure and confined to the user's local environment.
  - Learn more about static exports here: [Next.js Static Exports Documentation](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/deploying/static-exports).
